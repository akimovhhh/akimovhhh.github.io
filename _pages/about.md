I am a third-year PhD student in Quantitative Marketing at UC Berkeley Haas. My research interests include Industrial Organization, Structural Demand Estimation, and Pricing Dynamics.

## Working Papers and Research in Progress

### Asymmetric Pricing in the U.S. Egg Market (Research in Progress)
- Documenting "rockets and feathers" pricing asymmetry using USDA and BLS data.
- Developing a demand model to distinguish consumer-side reasons (preferences shift/search frictions) from tacit coordination.

### Predatory Pricing? A Case Study of Southwest's Entry into Hawaii (Working Paper)
- Implemented a dynamic event-study design using the imputation estimator to identify the causal impact of entry on fares.
- Constructed granular cost measures from BTS Form 41 and T-100 data to detect persistent negative markups.
- Analyzed capacity expansion and load factor dynamics to investigate predatory commitment mechanisms.

### Demand Estimation with Time-Varying Coefficients (Research in Progress)
- Investigating econometric techniques for estimating demand parameters that evolve over time.
